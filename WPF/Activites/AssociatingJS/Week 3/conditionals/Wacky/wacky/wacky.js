// My Wacky Condition

// This conditional script shows the average amount of sleep a human being gets in a lifetime. 



var daysInYear = 365; //Days in a year.
var lifeSpan = 78.6; //Average lifespan of a human being.
var yourNumber = prompt("How much sleep do you get a night? (Answer in a whole number)"); //number input for the sleep you get per night.
var averageSleep = yourNumber; 
var sleepAYear = yourNumber * daysInYear; // The amount of sleep in hours you would get a year.
var averageSleep = averageSleep * daysInYear * lifeSpan; //Average sleep in a lifetime. 
console.log("You sleep an average of", yourNumber,"hours a night. Which in a year totals out to be", sleepAYear," hours a year and",averageSleep, " hours in your lifetime.");




//average sleep 7
//average lifespan 78.6 
// 365 a year
