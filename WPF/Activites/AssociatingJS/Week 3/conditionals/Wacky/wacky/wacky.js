// My Wacky Condition

// This conditional script shows the average amount of sleep a human being gets in a lifetime. 



var daysInYear = 365;
var lifeSpan = 78.6;
var yourNumber = prompt("How much sleep do you get a night? (Answer in a whole number)");
var averageSleep = yourNumber;
var sleepAYear = yourNumber * daysInYear;
var averageSleep = averageSleep * daysInYear * lifeSpan;
console.log("You sleep an average of", yourNumber,"hours a night. Which in a year totals out to be", sleepAYear," hours a year and",averageSleep, " hours in your lifetime.");




//average sleep 7
//average lifespan 78.6 
// 365 a year
